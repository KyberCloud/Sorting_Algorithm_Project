# Sorting_Algorithm_Project
A script to test sorting algorithms with different files with ranging values with semi real world data types.

Hello! 
This project was completed as my final project for CS50 on edx through Harvard. I decided to take a more in depth look into sorting algorithms and wanted to learn which one was the best in semi-real world cases. I did this by creating random files, files that are already sorted, revered files and file that are partitioned at the halfway mark to give more tests.

If you're interested please take a look, run it like this "python ./Script --sort ." and inside the code you will fin 'numsList', change the numbers in this list to change the sizes of the test cases you would like to run for each sorting algorithm. You can also edit/add/remove sorting algorithms in thier entirety youreself on the top section of my code. 

So far the algorithms currently in the script are, Quick sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort and Tim sort(this is also the default sorting algorithm of python and other programming languages, as well as the assertion tester later in the runtime of this program.)

Also, the Script will print out a Plotly Express line graph showing your numerical results visually!
